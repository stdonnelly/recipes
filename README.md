# Recipes

This is a repository with various recipes I sometimes cook. This is mainly just a project for me to keep all of my recipes in one place, but I don't have a good reason for keeping it private. I have not yet bothered adding a license to this project, but I don't have any issues with other people using this.

Most of these are based on recipes from other websites, such as [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/). Any original recipes will be cited at the end of the recipe posed here. I could not find clear information on whether derivative works of publicly-posted recipes are allowed. If they are not, please raise an issue about that and I will take this down.

Currently there are three categories, represented by folders of this repository:

1. Entrees - Food I would eat as a meal.
2. Desserts - Sweets, such as cakes, pies (excluding pies like chicken pie), and cookies.
3. Intermediate Products - Components of other recipes, such as pie crusts.
