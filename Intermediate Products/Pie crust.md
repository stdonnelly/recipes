# Pie crust

## Ingredients

- Flour - 2 cups
- Fat - 14 tbsp
- Salt (if the fat is not already salted) - 1 tsp
- Baking powder &frac14; tsp
- Egg - 1
- Water &frac14; cup
- (optional) Sugar - 2 tsp
- (optional) Vinegar - 1&half; tsp

## Instructions

1. Mix the dry ingredients with the fat using a pastry cutter.
2. Mix the wet ingredients in a separate bowl. Add only enough to the dry mixture to be able to form dough balls by hand.
3. Shape the dough into 2 equal balls.
4. Put in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes, depending on the type of fat used.
5. Roll out with plenty of flour on the rolling mat, rolling pin, and your hands.

## Notes

- Makes 2 9-inch pie crusts
- Most solid fats can be used. Butter tastes the best in my opinion, but is only workable at a very specific temperature. I usually use up to 4 tbsp (2 fl oz) of bacon grease and the other 10 tbsp as butter. Any more bacon grease and the pie crust will taste too strongly of bacon. Crisco can also be mixed with the butter to make it behave better.
